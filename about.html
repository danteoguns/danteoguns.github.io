<h2>Experience</h2>
<div>
    <h3>QA Consulting – IT Consultant </h3>
    <p><b>Agile</b></p>
    <p>I grasped the principles of Agile Software Methodology and went into detail on how to use Agile Scrum in a working environment by doing group projects and presentations. The objective of this topic was to identify how Agile is used to manage a project compared to other frameworks. Some of the other frameworks I covered were Extreme Programming (XP) and Dynamic Systems Development Model (DSDM) to see the different benefits and drawbacks of each methodology. I partook in a group presentation based on DSDM and was then assigned a task of working in a Scrum team. I took the role as Scrum Master making me responsible for the sprint planning and ensuring the product backlog was completed to a high standard.</p>

    <p><b>Database</b></p>
    <p>I covered SQL while working in Oracle databases, which is different to working with Microsoft databases. With the use of a virtual machine client (Virtual Box) I was able to learn how to implement the different sublanguages which are: Data Retrieval (DRL), Data Definition (DDL), Data Manipulation (DML), Data Control (DCL) and Transaction Control (TCL).
        <br><br>
        I was able to apply the concept of using multiple functions to construct queries, which were used to extract information from the database. The Join functions were also used to put useful information together to help with decision making.</p>

    <p><b>Java SE</b></p>
    <p>I covered Java SE which was very interesting for me as I covered the four principles of Java which are Polymorphism, Inheritance, Encapsulation and Abstraction and was able to put them into practice. Alongside with the principles, the concepts of variables, methods, manipulating strings and primitive data types by doing several individual exercises to gain more extensive knowledge on Java. Since I’ve been preparing to be an IT Consultant, peer programming was involved to further improve my team working skills.</p>

    <p><b>Automated Testing</b></p>
    <p>I was introduced to the practices and processes of automated testing, alongside with the tools to use for productive testing. There are three types of driven development processes that I covered which are: data (DDT), test (TDD) and behavioural (BDD). Several tools were covered to effectively follow these processes which are: JUnit, Katalon, Selenium and Cucumber. I learnt how to require the dependencies of these tools to add to the Project Object Model xml file in a Maven project. The most important aspect that I covered were the Seven Principles of Testing as they are guidelines to testing.</p>

    <p><b>ISTQB</b></p>
    <p>I covered the ISTQB syllabus to prepare for the examination to receive the certification. This was highly important as the syllabus covers a wide range of topics such as the fundamentals of testing, design techniques, testing tools and more. This course gave me further insight to testing and on how to apply each technique.</p>

    <p><b>Advanced Testing</b></p>
    <p>I learned new tools to be used for API and Performance Testing. The tools to be applied for API Testing are: Postman for testing web services and SoapUI for testing SOAP and RESTful web services. Also, I learnt several types of performance testing such smoke, spike, stress, load testing and more. I gained understanding of their differences and why they should be applied by using Apache JMeter to do testing on SwaggerUI and localhost websites.</p>

    <p><b>Linux</b></p>
    <p>I got familiar with using another operating system by using Virtual Box. I acquired knowledge on manipulating files and directories in the terminal with different commands on how to create, remove, move/copy and assign/remove permissions to them. Similarly, I was able to create/remove users and change their ownership on reading/writing/executing files and directories. </p>

    <p><b>Java EE </b></p>
    <p>Regarding Java EE, I learned how Java Virtual Machine (JVM) runs Java program and how it executes Java bytecodes by converting .java files to .class files then to bytecodes. While implementing JavaScript in my project, I learnt to work with several objects by using the Document Object Model (DOM) standard to access documents.
        <br><br>
        To gain better understanding, an individual and group project was delegated to complete according to the requirements given. The projects consisted of gaining an understanding of the different layers needed for a full stack application. This was implemented by using Spring Boot for the localhost server, VueJS for the client-side interface with a H2 for the database. </p>
